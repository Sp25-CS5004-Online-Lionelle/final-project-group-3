## Filter And Sort Options
![Filter Options](FilterOptions.png)
Users can add filter strings into the Filter textbox to apply them. They should be in the form:

<center> &ltcolumnName> &ltoperation> &ltvalue> </center>


- \<columnName> is the name of the column to filter on (e.g., "Name", "Population", etc.).
- \<operation> is the comparison operator. It can be one of the following:   
    - "==" : equals 
    - "<"  : less than
    - ">"  : greater than
    - "<=" : less than or equal to
    - ">=" : greater than or equal to
    - "!=" : not equal to
    - "~=" : contains

- \<value> is the value to compare against. It should be a valid value for the specified column.  

For example, to filter animals with a population greater than 10000, the filter string would be: <center>`Population > 10000`</center>

Multiple filters can be applied at once by separating them with a comma. For example, to filter animals with a population greater than 10000 and a name that contains "lion", the filter string would be: <center>`Population > 10000, Name ~= lion`</center>

The user then uses the Sort On dropdown to select the column to sort the results of the filter and the order radio buttons to select the order of the sort. Name and ascending order are selected by default and can be left as is.  

**Note:** To only sort the collections list, leave the filter Textbox emply, select the column to sort on, the order of the sort, and click the "Apply" button. The app will sort the list based on the selected column and order.



## Filtered List

You can clear the filter by clicking the Clear Filter or Search button or just going back to the main collection screen. The app will reset the filter and display all animals in the collection again.
